### 2023
#### Supporting Mission Assurance and Securing Autonomous Systems through Cyber-worthiness Principles
*Military Computer Information Systems Conference 2023*

*Australian Defence Force Cyber Skills Challenge November 2023*

Technology in Australia is evolving and we are seeing a natural convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) concepts. As the demand for autonomy in systems increases, gradually removing humans from the decision-making process, it is critical to emphasise the need for wholly assured resilient systems. Compounded with this, unlike a traditional system where the platform/crew of the capability are developed and evaluated, the platform in an autonomous system is responsible for all operations. Therefore, the software of the platform is explicitly linked to the safety of that system; when actions are driven by 1’s and 0’s within lines of code, the potential to steer a ship into a catastrophic event or instruct a helicopter to shut off enabling systems is inherently greater. Cyber-worthiness principles can inform trust and assurance methods to help secure autonomous systems used in support of military operations.

This presentation explores the development of processes for the application of cyber-worthiness principles—the concept of developing a system that can defend against cyber intrusions within a given mission context—and its application within an overall mission assurance context. We discuss the importance of the mounting of a safety case for an autonomous platform, and how lessons learnt from the IT side of the IT/OT divide can be applied and tailored for mission critical systems.

#### 2013-2023 in Cyber: Why are you still banging your head against a brick wall? 
*SecTalks Canberra February 2023*

I was driving home recently and realised it had been a decade to the day that I had
entered the cyber security industry, both bright eyed and bushy tailed - way back when cyber was a euphemism for something you did in your bedroom. 10 years later, slightly jaded, somewhat cynical, but still passionate as ever, I have worked with some amazing people through some of the most interesting and quickly evolving times of our industry. 

This presentation covers the last ten years of cyber security history, picking out the most important (in my opinion) events of each year, and describing the lessons learnt from them from someone who lived them.

### 2021
#### So you want to build a Security Operations Capability?
*BSides Perth Sept 2021*

*Australian Defence Force Cyber Skills Challenge Aug 2022*

Building a Security Operations capability from scratch is hard. How many people do you need? What processes should you use? What tools can you implement? Should you go 24/7 or 8/5? This presentation discusses some of the thought processes and key
questions that are required in order to develop a successful Security Operations
capability, and how you can develop a function that meets the needs of the business,
whilst ensuring that stakeholders don't see it as a "financial sink" and see the value provided to the business.

#### Transitioning Cyber Security to a Mission Risk Mindset (aka, why the new ISM is better)
*Military Computer Information Systems Conference 2019*

{{< youtube nvsIV3SYEQ4 >}}

{{< embed-pdf url="Transitioning Cyber Security to a Mission Risk Mindset (aka, why the new ISM is better).pdf" >}}

The Australian Signals Directorate has recently removed all traditional references to “should” and “must” from the Information Security Manual. This means that there are no longer a defined set of security controls that must be in place to achieve accreditation of secure and classified networks. This represents a transition in the way that the government treats cyber security, and will enable and delegate the responsibility for government and industry partners to determine their own cyber security risk, their risk appetite, and in turn use these to determine what security controls they need to implement to achieve an accepted level of risk. This presentation discusses the impact of these changes, as well as the industry wide transition from a compliance or “checklist” based cyber security strategy, to one more in line with traditional business or mission risk.

### 2019
#### Cyber Threat Intelligence: It’s not just about the feeds
*BSides Perth Sept 2019*

Although the practice of collecting and using intelligence has been studied and
conducted by governments and the military for centuries, it’s relative application to Cyber Security has only recently been highlighted. This area of infosec has been
termed Cyber Threat Intelligence, where the marriage of traditional intelligence
techniques and analysis with deep technical understanding within the Cyber domain are used to predict future actions by threats through long term analysis and modelling. This approach is then used to support both proactive and reactive cyber security actions, from incident response to penetration testing. This presentation focuses on threat intelligence from a practical data perspective, moving away from just the commercial concept of threat intelligence feeds (although these form one part of the equation). 

This presentation will approach threat intelligence from an analysts perspective of what questions needs to be answered to effectively investigate an incident, using the Diamond Model and Cyber Kill Chain as framing devices. These questions will then lead to examples of the data that can be used to answer these questions. Although traditionally data collection has focused on external cyber information, more often than not however, it’s actions outside of those seen within an organisations network, or even outside cyberspace that can provide context to the actions a threat takes. Finally, we provide a number of use cases on which the results of threat intelligence processes can be applied within a Security Operations Centre, including Incident Response as well as traditional Penetration Testing and Red Teaming.

#### Text Classification of Network Intrusion Alerts to Enhance Cyber Situation Awareness and Automate Alert Triage
*DST Group May 2017*

For many Cyber Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT), reacting and responding
to suspicious network activity is predominantly a manual task and lacks the necessary levels of automation required to deal with the volume of alerts. Alerts are signalled from tools such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to skilled analysts who must then decide on courses of action and remediation activities. The IDS alerts are basic; analysts must manually derive context about the alert using their prior knowledge. 

In this paper, we describe Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques used to automate the derivation of context from IDS alerts. We propose two algorithms based on well-known automated text classification methods and define a multi-level taxonomy to describe classifications of alerts in a semantically hierarchical manner. Consideration is given to the use of these algorithms by a CSIRT, as well as how Situation Awareness (SA) can be improved through automation. Our findings show that a combination of Naïve Bayes algorithms in conjunction with our proposed hierarchical taxonomy can automate alert classification with high accuracy, and low false and unclassified rates.
